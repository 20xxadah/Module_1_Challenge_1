CASE STUDY - PAYPAL
FINTECH CASE STUDY - PAYPAL

Overview and Origin

Paypal Holdings Inc, commonly knowns as ‘PayPal’, was originally established by Max Levchin, a Ukrainian-American software engineer and businessman, Peter Thiel, a German-American billionaire entrepreneur and venture-capitalist and Luke Nosek, a Polish-American entrepreneur, in 1998 as ‘Confinity’, whose original line of business was the development of security software for hand-held devices, before switching to a better business model- becoming a digital wallet. Its first version was launched in 1999. After which there  was a merger in March 2000, between Confinity and X.com, a financial services provider owned by Elon Musk,Harris Fricker, Ed Ho and Christopher Payne. Following the merger, the founders noticed the complexities in making online payments and they worked towards creating an efficient solution. The initial concept was to create a digital wallet to facilitate online money transfers, they recognized the potential of the growing digital marketplace and saw the need for a reliable online payment platform[1] 

In June 2001, X.com was renamed PayPal, and in 2002 went public at $13 and raised over $61million on its first IPO. In early 2022, market cap for Paypal was around US$210billion[2]  

Paypal is currently a publicly listed company with annual revenue of US$21billion as at 2020 [1]
Business Activities

PayPal’s services allow people process financial transactions online through electronic funds transfer between individuals and businesses. Users can make and receive payments on e-commerce sites like eBay, purchase or sell goods and services, or make and receive donations for various causes. [1]

The service allows anyone make or receive payments in any way they prefer, including credit cards, bank accounts without sharing financial information.

Paypal caters to individuals and businesses to facilitate movement of funds for various reasons and has quickly become a global leader in online payments with more than 325million active users, available in 202 countries and 25 currencies, enabling e-commerce across different locations, languages and currencies (www.paypal.com Links to an external site.)

The company allows individuals and merchants to get paid in more than 25 currencies in over 200 countries. It also has a wide range of services and products to make the process of payments easier, including online invoicing, credit card acceptance, and buy now pay later options, to name a few. [1]

Its major competitive edge is being able to accept the largest number of currencies and is accepted in more countries than any other online payment platform.

To achieve this competitive edge in the industry, PayPal employs various technologies. 

Programming Languages include Java, Javascript and Python for its backend systems and APIs, along with HTML, CSS and Javascript for frontend development

For web development, they employ various tools including Spring Boot, Node.js and Django, as well as React and Angular for building user interfaces. For cloud infrastructure, platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). For scalability and reliability, they adopted technolies like Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra and Apache Zookeeperfor date streaming, distributed storage and coordination. Hadoop is used for Big Data Analytics.

Landscape

The payment landscape is a combination of players that interact during a particular payment process. Examples include credit card networks, payment gateways, payment processors, issuers and acquirers, value-added resellers and payment facilitators.

Paypal currently plays in the online payments domain as a payment gateway. Its role is primarily to enable merchants accept and transmit data for processing. One of the most important aspects of a payment gateway is the strength of its security infrastructure put in place to protect cardholder data during transmission. When a customer uses their payment card, the payment gateway securely sends the customer’s card information to the payment processor. Some gateways, like Cardknox, also provide merchants with a broader range of payment processing features and benefits. [3]

Recent trends in the last 5-10 years have witnessed the giants of tech coming into the payment processing space, merging with and in some cases, acquiring other tech companies to get closer to their customers. They have partnered with banks to drive their new ventures. These include Apple and Amazon and other players in the various domains  as can be seen in the image above.

The pandemic brought about major changes and innovations in payment processes:

Contactless Payment - As the global pandemic unfolded, consumers became acutely aware of heightened health risks at checkout. As a result, contactless payments have been on the rise. However, in addition to avoiding physical contact, the benefits of speed and convenience will continue to appeal to shoppers even as the pandemic winds down. In a 2020 Mastercard global consumer study, nearly eight in 10 consumers say they use contactless payments. This trend appears to be here to stay as approximately 74% state they will continue to use contactless post-pandemic. [3]

Digital Wallets - As the adoption of mobile devices has grown over the past few years, so has the number of consumers using digital wallet apps on their smartphones to make purchases. Although the term is often used interchangeably with mobile wallets, the two are slightly different. While both digital wallets and mobile wallets store payment information, a mobile wallet is a payment app used to make in-store purchases from a mobile device—examples include Walmart Pay, Google Pay, and Apple Pay. “Digital wallet” is an overarching term that includes mobile wallets, but digital wallets can also make online purchases, transfer funds between friends and family, and store other types of data, including gift cards, loyalty cards, and ID cards. Popular digital wallets include the previously mentioned mobile wallet apps as well as apps like PayPal, Zelle, Samsung Pay, and many others. [3]

Recommendations/Outlook

After reviewing the company and its impact in the payment industry, I recommend that Paypal explores the NeoBank space, which is an emerging domain which has generated USD 4550 Billion worth of transaction value [5]. This would be an opportunity for Paypal to offer full-service digital banking solutions. Similar technologies already employed for its existing products can also be used to develop a Neobank.
